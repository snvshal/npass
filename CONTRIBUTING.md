# Contributing to npass

Thanks for considering contributing! A few guidelines:

- Fork the repo and open a PR against `main` (or `master`).
- Run `cargo test` before submitting; CI will run tests automatically.
- Keep changes small and focused; update README and add tests for new behavior.
- For large features, open an issue first to discuss design.
